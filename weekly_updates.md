Meetings:

21.11-30.11:
 

progress:

read Multirotor Aerial Vehicle and Minimum Snap  <br /> 
read Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotors  <br /> 
read Dynamics Modelling and Linear Control of Quadcopter <br />
beginng implementing basic forward propagation <br /> 


next week plans:

check out the data <br /> 
implementing basic forward propagation <br /> 

discussion:

What is the output data of the forward propagation <br />

01.12-08.12: 


progress:

read [2] <br /> 
decode and plot the data <br /> 
implemting basic forward propagation <br /> 


next week plans:

use the forward propagation model with data <br /> 
calculate model error <br /> 

09.12-15.12:

progress:

plot the data <br /> 
propagate the data <br /> 

next week plans:

compute model error<br /> 

discussion:

the output of the model is very different to the original data (accelerati9on original between 0-1 and output -3000 <br /> 


16.12-21.12:

progress;
plot the conparison of the data and model and the error of the model <br  />
calculate f_a and tau_a of the residual model

discussion:

the error of the model is really high (both angular and linear) -> error in the code of newton euler equation
